# hangmanPy
trying to create a simple hangman game, will definitely refactor the code because it's currently spaghetti-ly.

How to start:
Run server.py and client.py on different terminal.
(Currently support only one client, will be updated in the future.)

Instruction:
The player has to guess the letters of the given target word.
They will be given 5 lives, which means 4 chances for incorrect answers.

If the player guess a letter that they already guessed, they won't lose a game life since it won't count as an incorrect answer.

If the player can guess every letters in the given word correctly, they win.
Otherwise, they will lose.
